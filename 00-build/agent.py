"""Cortex, a minimal, explicit agent loop you (and your coding agent) can read end
to end. This is the agent you ship: your PM chief-of-staff. You build it by
directing your coding agent (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex) to shape this file. You
never have to hand-write it.

Every bound the course talks about is visible right here in code, not buried in a
framework: the max-iteration counter, the cost cap, the revision cap, the
stop/escalate conditions, the auto-queue cap, and the absence of any publish tool.

Usage (ask your coding agent to run these for you, or run them yourself):
    python agent.py                # runs the happy-path task (weekly status update)
    python agent.py missing-data   # the stuck/escalate case
    python agent.py jailbreak       # the prompt-injection refusal case

Every run ends by showing the drafted status update in a FINAL STATUS UPDATE block
(or LAST DRAFT, held, if a bound trips), and saves it to run-output/. That file is
always a draft held for a human, it is never posted, there is no publish tool.

Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment (see .env.example). Model and bounds
are read from env so you can tune them, that tuning is your M5 deliverable.

The loop is deliberately transparent (hand-written tool-calling on the openai
client) so a grader can see the machinery. Keep the bounds explicit if you rework it.
